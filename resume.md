## About Me

Information technology has always been my passion. When I wrote my first lines of code (VB.NET) and executed them, the idea “computed”! After earning my degree in application development, I entered the workforce and began self-teaching. This decision has proven highly successful. Over the past 13 years, I’ve worked for several top-tier companies, started my own consultancy, and gained significant expertise in JavaScript.

I’m also interested in micro and cloud architecture, mobile app development, and UI/UX design. In my work, I use frameworks like React, Node.js, and other JavaScript-oriented tools. I enjoy hosting my projects on Amazon Web Services (AWS), designing in Figma, and using GitHub for version control.

I am detail-oriented, inquisitive, and a team player. I love coaching others to help them reach their full potential. I’m always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow. I’m excited to see where my career will take me next!
